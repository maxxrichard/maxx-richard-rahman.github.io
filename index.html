            <h2>Welcome to My Personal Website</h2>
            <p>I am a PhD student at Saarland University, Germany, and a Scientific Researcher at the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI). My research focuses on developing advanced machine learning techniques, specifically in spatio-temporal analysis, multivariate sequential learning, and longitudinal analysis. I am working on designing robust methods for anomaly detection and investigating the capabilities of foundation models, including large language models, to enhance their application across various domains.</p>
            <p>My current projects involve applying these methodologies to areas such as doping detection in sports, healthcare analytics, and quantum machine learning. By combining theoretical advancements with practical applications, I aim to contribute to the development of data-driven solutions that address complex challenges in these fields.</p>
